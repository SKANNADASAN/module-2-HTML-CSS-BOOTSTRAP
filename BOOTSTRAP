BOOTSTRAP 4.6;

Bootstrap is used as a framework  for building responsiveness in devices.

GRID SYSTEM;

twelve column system.

WHY?

12 can be easily divided into portions(4:4:4,6:6,3:3:3:3,2:2:2:2:2:2)

One percent = (1/12)*100 =8.33%

BOOTSTRAP FLOW OF ELEMENTS;
Container =>Row=>column

CONTAINER CAN HAVE MANY ROWS.
BUT ONE ROW ALSO CAN HAVE MORE THAN 12 (0R) LESS THAN 12 COLUMN (BUT MOST PREFERRABLE COLUMN IS LESS THAN 12 IN ONE ROW).
